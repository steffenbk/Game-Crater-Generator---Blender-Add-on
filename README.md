Game Crater Generator - Blender Add-on
A professional Blender plugin for generating realistic, game-ready crater meshes with advanced procedural controls and optimization features.
Key Features:
Dual Radius System

Separate outer and inner radius controls for precise crater shaping
Independent depth and rim height parameters

Advanced Wall Controls

Outer wall angle for bottom closure geometry
Inner wall angle for crater bowl slope control
Create anything from vertical drops to slanted, realistic impact craters

Explosion Realism

Blast asymmetry for directional explosion effects
Edge fragmentation for naturally broken crater rims
Rim height variation with noise scaling

Smart Randomization

Individual min/max ranges for every parameter
Separate controls for outer/inner radius randomization
Explosion realism randomization ranges

Game-Ready Output

Automatic triangulation and topology optimization
Dual-zone material assignment (inner crater + outer slope)
Smart UV mapping with island packing
Poly count estimation and performance indicators

Professional Features

Closed bottom geometry with thickness control
Inside/outside surface noise zones
One-click parameter reset
Clean, organized UI with real-time feedback

Perfect for game developers, VFX artists, and 3D designers who need high-quality crater geometry for environments, battle damage, or sci-fi scenes. Compatible with Blender 4.2+.
