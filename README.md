## Key Features

### Dual Radius System

* Separate **outer** and **inner radius** controls for precise crater shaping.
* Independent **depth** and **rim height** parameters for flexibility.

### Advanced Wall Controls

* **Outer wall angle** to define closed bottom geometry.
* **Inner wall angle** to adjust crater bowl slopes.
* Create anything from sheer vertical drops to naturally slanted craters.

### Explosion Realism

* **Blast asymmetry** for directional explosion effects.
* **Edge fragmentation** to simulate broken, uneven rims.
* **Rim height variation** with procedural noise.

### Randomization Tools

* **Min/max ranges** for every parameter.
* Independent randomization for **outer** and **inner radius**.
* Randomize explosion realism effects for unique crater variations.

### Game-Ready Output

* **Automatic triangulation** and optimized topology.
* **Dual-zone material assignment** (inner crater and outer slope).
* **Smart UV mapping** with packed islands.
* Built-in **polygon count estimation** and performance indicators.

### Additional Features

* **Closed bottom geometry** with adjustable thickness.
* Separate **inside/outside surface noise zones**.
* **One-click parameter reset**.
